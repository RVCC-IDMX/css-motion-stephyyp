         SECTION 1: MICRO INTERACTION
         A small UI element with subtle hover feedback
         ============================================ -->
    <section class="motion-section" id="micro-interaction">
      <h2>Section 1: Micro Interaction</h2>

      <!-- Container for your interactive element -->
      <div class="micro-container">
        <!-- Chosen element: button with hover + focus motion -->
        <button class="interactive-element">
          Hover or Focus Me
        </button>
        <!-- Add your transform and transition in CSS -->
        <!-- Remember: smooth state change, 250-400ms duration -->
      </div>

      <!-- Caption explaining the motion's personality -->
      <p class="motion-caption">
        This micro interaction has a calm, responsive personality. On hover and focus, the button gently lifts
        and slightly increases its opacity over a 300ms transform-based transition, so it feels alive and interactive
        without being loud or distracting.

         SECTION 2: TIMING COMPARISON
         Two identical elements with different timing functions
         ============================================ -->

      <h2>Section 2: Timing Comparison</h2>

      <!-- Container for side-by-side comparison -->
      <div class="comparison-container">

        <!-- Element 1: First timing function -->

        </div>

      </div>

      <!-- Explanation of timing differences -->
      <p class="motion-caption">
        Both buttons move over the same duration, but their timing curves create very different feelings.
        The ease-out button feels smooth and predictable, slowing down gently as it finishes the motion.
        The custom cubic-bezier button feels more playful and energetic, with a sharper acceleration that
        gives the interaction a bit of “bounce,” even though the distance and duration are the same.

         SECTION 3: FEATURE CARD (3D FLIP)
         Card that flips to reveal content on back
         Based on Kevin Powell tutorial foundation
         ============================================ -->
   <section class="motion-section" id="feature-card">
  <h2>Section 3: Feature Card (3D Flip)</h2>

  <!-- Card container -->
  <div class="card-container" tabindex="0" aria-label="Interactive feature card that flips to reveal more details">

      <!-- Front face of card -->
      <div class="card-face card-front">
        <h3>Card Front: Feature Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The front of this card gives a quick overview of the feature. Hover or focus
          to flip and reveal more detailed information on the back.
        </p>

      <div class="card-face card-back">
        <h3>Card Back: Details</h3>
        <p>
          The back of the card expands on the idea with more explanation. The 3D flip uses
          a 500ms transform-based rotation so the layout stays stable while only the card
          content changes in place.

         Reflection paragraph and accessibility notes

      <!-- Accessibility implementation note -->
      <div class="accessibility-note">
        <h3>Reduced Motion Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          Across all three sections, I used the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media query to turn off
          animated transitions for users who request reduced motion. When that preference is enabled, elements
          still change state, but they do so instantly or with very minimal change to opacity instead of
          animated transforms. This keeps the interface usable while avoiding potentially uncomfortable motion.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Personal reflection -->
      <div class="reflection-text">
        <h3>Design Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Building this motion board helped me see how much timing and easing curves change the “personality”
          of an interaction, even when the distance and duration stay the same. I was surprised by how subtle
          adjustments in the cubic-bezier curve could make a button feel calm, snappy, or playful.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 3D feature card is the demo that best expresses my intent, because it feels dynamic and modern
          without breaking the layout or overwhelming the rest of the page. Overall, I learned that motion
          works best when it supports clarity and feedback first, and only then adds style and personality
          on top of a solid, accessible foundation.
